A hamburger menu button for the Emacs mode line.

Use instead of `menu-bar-mode' to save vertical space.  The hamburger
menu is particularly useful when `mouse-autoselect-window' (Focus
Follows Mouse) is enabled.

## Installation

Add the [MELPA](https://melpa.org/) repository to Emacs.  Then run:

    M-x package-install hamburger-menu

Configuration is required.  To see the instructions, run:

    M-x describe-package hamburger-menu
